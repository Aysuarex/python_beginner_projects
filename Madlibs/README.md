# MadlibsðŸŽ²

This is a basic game of Madlibs made with Python. Madlibs is basically
 a string concatenation game where you have a passage with a bunch of
 blanks in them. The user is then prompted to fill out those blanks with
 parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns etc) and then print
 out the passage with the words that the user filled in the prompt.

There are 6 madlibs to choose from and running the program ```madlibs.py```
 with ```python madlibs.py``` or ```python3 madlibs.py``` as the case may be,
 selects at random one of the sample madlibs contained within the sample_madlibs
 directory.

Enjoy!

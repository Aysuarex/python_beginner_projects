# HangmanüéõÔ∏è

## Introduction :eyes: 
This is a basic game of hangman written with Python.

## How It works :rocket:

* You're given 6 attempts to guess the letters within a word
 that was randomly selected from a list of multiple words.
 You could also guess the entire word right away.
* If you guess a letter correctly, you do not lose an attempt. 

There are hundreds of words to choose from and running the program ```hangman.py```
 with ```python hangman.py``` or ```python3 hangman.py``` as the case may be,
 selects at random one of the words contained within the words.py file and you're
 will attempt to guess it a letter at a time (or not).

Enjoy!

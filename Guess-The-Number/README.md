# Guess The NumberðŸ¤”

## Introduction :eyes: 
This is a basic game of guess the number made with Python.

## How It works :rocket:

* First, you are prompted to for an upper limit/boundary 
betweeen 10 and 100,000 as the maximum value for all guesses.
* You're then asked to choose between the two modes available 
in the game:
    * Player guesses the computer's randomly selected number
    * Computer randomly guesses the player's inputted number

It's a pretty fun game play, and it's also good practice for Python beginners. Enjoy!
